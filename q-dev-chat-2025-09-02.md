I want to build a web application for resorts booking where I can upload images and change price tag discripton of the resorts

---

I'll help you build a web application for resort booking with image upload and price/description management features. Let me first explore your workspace structure to understand the current setup.

---

The workspace appears to be empty. I'll create a minimal resort booking web application with the following structure:

1. **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API endpoints
3. **Features**: Image upload, price/description editing, resort listing

Let me create the basic structure:

---

Creating package.json with minimal dependencies for the resort booking app

---

Creating Express server with API endpoints for resort CRUD operations and image upload

---

Creating directories for static files and uploaded images

---

shell

---

Creating HTML structure with forms for adding/editing resorts and displaying resort list

---

Creating CSS styles for the resort booking interface with responsive design

---

Creating JavaScript functionality for CRUD operations, image upload, and dynamic UI updates

---

Creating README with setup instructions and project overview

---


Your resort booking web application is now ready! Here's what I've created:

## Key Features:
- **Image Upload**: Upload resort images with automatic file handling
- **Price Management**: Add/edit resort prices with validation
- **Description Editing**: Full CRUD operations for resort descriptions
- **Responsive UI**: Clean interface that works on different screen sizes

## Project Structure:
- `server.js` - Express backend with API endpoints
- `public/index.html` - Main interface
- `public/style.css` - Styling
- `public/script.js` - Frontend functionality
- `package.json` - Dependencies

## To run the application:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

The app includes:
- Form to add new resorts with image upload
- Resort cards displaying image, name, price, and description
- Edit modal for updating resort information
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- File upload handling with multer
- In-memory storage (easily replaceable with a database)

You can now upload images, set prices, edit descriptions, and manage your resort listings through the web interface!
